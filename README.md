# Natural-Language-Processing

## Describe your project

Dillon is my partner. 

In this project, the purpose is to create a randomized username based on the letter inputs through the console. There's a total of 5 tabs, 2 of them being text files that provide the randomized adjectives and nouns. After inputting, the user will receive their full username, along with a series of random numbers. 

There are 2 classes: UserGiver and TextProcessor. 

The methods found in UserGiver are chooseAdjective and chooseNoun. Both of these methods determine the possible return statements based on the letter that is submitted. For example, if a user responds with the letter "a", it will return a random adjective or noun found in the textfile. Let's say it returns "academic"; the program will ask a following question that needs the same kind of response. 

This is what the output looks like:
